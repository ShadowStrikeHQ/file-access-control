# File Access Control Analysis Tool: `file-access-control`

## 1. Overview

`file-access-control` is a command-line tool designed to analyze and manage file permissions and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enhance system security.  It focuses on detecting potential vulnerabilities related to improper file access control, ensuring data protection, and validating compliance with security policies.  This tool is primarily intended for security auditing and proactive risk mitigation.


## 2. Analysis Purposes

This tool serves the following security analysis purposes:

* **Security Monitoring:**  Identifies files with overly permissive permissions that could be exploited by attackers.
* **Data Protection:** Helps enforce least privilege by identifying files accessible to users or groups beyond their necessary roles.
* **System Integrity Checks:** Verifies that file permissions align with established security baselines and configurations.
* **Compliance Validation:** Assists in meeting regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) by ensuring files containing sensitive data have appropriate access restrictions.

## 3. Installation

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.7+ and the following packages:

* `argparse>=1.4.0`
* `pathlib` (typically included with Python 3.4+)
* `logging` (typically included with Python)

**Installation Steps:**

1.  Clone the repository:  `git clone <repository_url>` (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual repository URL).
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd file-access-control`
3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming a `requirements.txt` file is present listing the dependencies).

## 4. Usage

The tool utilizes a command-line interface driven by `argparse`.  The following arguments are supported (further details will be provided in the future):

**(Note:  This section will be fleshed out as the tool's capabilities are fully defined.)**


**Basic Usage:**

```bash
python main.py <target_directory> --recursive --report <output_file>
```

* `<target_directory>`: The path to the directory to be analyzed.
* `--recursive`:  (Optional) Recursively analyzes subdirectories.
* `<output_file>`: (Optional) Specifies the path to save the analysis report. If omitted, a report will be printed to the console.


**Example with Safeguards:**

Analyzing a specific directory with a detailed report generated:

```bash
python main.py /home/user/sensitive_data --recursive --report sensitive_data_report.txt
```

**Important Safeguards:**

* Always run the tool with appropriate privileges.  Avoid running with root/administrator privileges unless absolutely necessary.
* Verify the integrity of the tool's source code before execution.
* Carefully review the generated reports to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.


## 5. Implementation Details (Security Focused)

* **Input Validation:** All user-supplied inputs (directory paths, file names) are rigorously validated to prevent path traversal and other injection attacks.
* **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling is implemented to prevent unexpected crashes and to provide informative error messages.
* **Logging:** Detailed logging is used for auditing purposes and for troubleshooting.  Log files include timestamps, user actions, and any detected issues.
* **Least Privilege:** The tool is designed to operate with the minimum necessary privileges, reducing the impact of potential compromises.
* **Secure File Handling:**  The tool utilizes secure file I/O methods to prevent accidental data corruption or disclosure.


## 6. Modules and Core Functions

The tool's core functionality is implemented in `main.py`.

* **`setup_argparse()`:** This function configures the command-line interface using `argparse`.
* **`main()`:** This function handles command-line argument parsing, performs the file access control analysis, and generates the report.


## 7. License and Compliance Information

**(To be added -  Specify the chosen open-source license and any relevant compliance certifications or statements.)**  For example:

## 8. Future Development

Future development will include:

* More sophisticated reporting capabilities.
* Support for different operating systems and file systems.
* Integration with other security tools.
* Advanced analysis capabilities (e.g., identifying inheritance anomalies in ACLs).
